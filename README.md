libps4-symbols
=====

> Used to track the most recent symbols by firmware for analysis and convenience

## Description
The symbols file is build by libps4-generator as part of its checking mechanism, which verifies that stubs are only created for existing symbols (functions). You may be interested in the symbols file for reverse engineering purposes or any other reason. We will track them here for your convenience.
